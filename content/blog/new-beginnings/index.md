## Why did i start this blog ?

Despite its really easy to setup a blog , i never took time to make one and write blogs in it, but here i'am.

It's been almost 3 years i started getting into software development. All this time i am more invested and focusted on code rather than my social skills.

But recently i thought i am not expressing myself to people around me. I understood it when one of my friend started sharing videos stuff about a topic. I explained him why i dont like that. Same thing happened for 2 more people. I started copy pasting my messages between them. Then it seemed better to express myself in blogs and use these to reflexct myself.

## What may be the domains i write about ?

I am very sure that atleast 80% of blogs will be about tech and code. All tech geeks and people intrested in tech can really take few cents out of them. But i will often write about religious frauds and crimes, which may enrage few people. But just to clear these are clearly my opinions only.

### That's it folks for the first one.
